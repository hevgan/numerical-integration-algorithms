# The objective of this project was to implement four numerical integration methods:
* rectangle rule
* [trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)
* [Simpson's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule)
* [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)

and use them to calculate the probability of a electronic device malfunctioning (in the first 5 years of use).

## The probability density function used for calculation:

### The second task was to use [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) metod to calculate the volume of a lake. 
### The [lake data](https://github.com/hevgan/numerical-integration-algorithms/blob/main/depth.m) was provided with the assignment .
